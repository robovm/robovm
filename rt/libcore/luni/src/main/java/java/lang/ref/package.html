      Provides the system's {@link java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue} implementation as well as
      different forms of reference objects which impose special behavior on the
      garbage collector. The behavior depends on the type of {@link java.lang.ref.Reference}
      being used. Three different type of references exist, each being weaker
      than the preceding one: {@link java.lang.ref.SoftReference}, {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference}, and
      {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}. "Weakness" here means that less restrictions are
      being imposed on the garbage collector as to when it is allowed to
      actually garbage-collect the referenced object.

      In order to use reference objects properly it is important to understand
      the different types of reachability that trigger their clearing and
      enqueueing. The following table lists these, from strongest to weakest.
      For each row, an object is said to have the reachability on the left side
      if (and only if) it fulfills all of the requirements on the right side. In
      all rows, consider the <em>root set</em> to be a set of references that
      are "resistant" to garbage collection (that is, running threads, method
      parameters, local variables, static fields and the like).
