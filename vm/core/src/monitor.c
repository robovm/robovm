/*
 * Every Object has a monitor associated with it, but not every Object is
 * actually locked.  Even the ones that are locked do not need a
 * full-fledged monitor until a) there is actual contention or b) wait()
 * is called on the Object.
 *
 * For Dalvik, we have implemented a scheme similar to the one described
 * in Bacon et al.'s "Thin locks: featherweight synchronization for Java"
 * (ACM 1998).  Things are even easier for us, though, because we have
 * a full 32 bits to work with.
 *
 * The two states of an Object's lock are referred to as "thin" and
 * "fat".  A lock may transition from the "thin" state to the "fat"
 * state and this transition is referred to as inflation.  Once a lock
 * has been inflated it remains in the "fat" state indefinitely.
 *
 * The lock value itself is stored in Object.lock.  The LSB of the
 * lock encodes its state.  When cleared, the lock is in the "thin"
 * state and its bits are formatted as follows:
 *
 *    [31 ---- 19] [18 ---- 3] [2 ---- 1] [0]
 *     lock count   thread id  hash state  0
 *
 * When set, the lock is in the "fat" state and its bits are formatted
 * as follows:
 *
 *    [31 ---- 3] [2 ---- 1] [0]
 *      pointer   hash state  1
 *
 * For an in-depth description of the mechanics of thin-vs-fat locking,
 * read the paper referred to above.
